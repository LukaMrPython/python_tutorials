    "\n",
    "Bubble sort is a very simple sorting algorithm. The algorithm starts at the beginning of the data set. It compares the first two elements, and if the first is greater than the second, it swaps them. It continues doing this for each pair of adjacent elements to the end of the data set. It then starts again with the first two elements, repeating until no swaps have occurred on the last pass. Over a number of passes, at most equal to the number of elements in the list, all of the values drift into their correct positions (large values “bubble” rapidly toward the end, pushing others down around them). Because each pass finds the maximum item and puts it at the end, the portion of the list to be sorted can be reduced at each pass. A boolean variable is used to track whether any changes have been made in the current pass; when a pass completes without changing anything, the algorithm exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm’s average and worst-case performance is O(n2), so it is rarely used to sort large, unordered data sets. Bubble sort can be used to sort a small number of items (where its asymptotic inefficiency is not a high penalty). Bubble sort can also be used efficiently on a list of any length that is nearly sorted (that is, the elements are not significantly out of place). For example, if any number of elements are out of place by only one position (e.g. 0123546789 and 1032547698), bubble sort’s exchange will get them in order on the first pass, the second pass will find all elements in order, so the sort will take only 2n time."

    "Insertion sort is an O(n2) sorting algorithm which moves elements one at a time into the correct position. The algorithm consists of inserting one element at a time into the previously sorted part of the array, moving higher ranked elements up as necessary. To start off, the first (or smallest, or any arbitrary) element of the unsorted array is considered to be the sorted part. It is relatively efficient for small lists and mostly sorted lists, and is often used as part of more sophisticated algorithms. In arrays, the new list and the remaining elements can share the array’s space, but insertion is expensive, requiring shifting all following elements over by one."

Its asymptotic complexity is O(n2) making it inefficient on large arrays. Its primary purpose is for when writing data is very expensive (slow) when compared to reading, eg. writing to flash memory or EEPROM. No other sorting algorithm has less data movement.

    "Heapsort is an in-place sorting algorithm with worst case and average complexity of O(n logn).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to turn the array into a binary heap structure, which has the property that it allows efficient retrieval and removal of the maximal element. We repeatedly “remove” the maximal element from the heap, thus building the sorted list from back to front. Heapsort requires random access, so can only be used on an array-like data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heapsort is a much more efficient version of selection sort. It also works by determining the largest (or smallest) element of the list, placing that at the end (or beginning) of the list, then continuing with the rest of the list, but accomplishes this task efficiently by using a data structure called a heap, a special type of binary tree. Once the data list has been made into a heap, the root node is guaranteed to be the largest (or smallest) element. When it is removed and placed at the end of the list, the heap is rearranged so the largest element remaining moves to the root. Using the heap, finding the next largest element takes O(log n) time, instead of O(n) for a linear scan as in simple selection sort. This allows Heapsort to run in O(n logn) time, and this is also the worst case complexity."

    "Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm which relies on a partition operation: to partition an array an element called a pivot is selected. All elements smaller than the pivot are moved before it and all greater elements are moved after it. This can be done efficiently in linear time and in-place. The lesser and greater sublists are then recursively sorted. This yields average time complexity of O(n log n), with low overhead, and thus this is a popular algorithm. Efficient implementations of quicksort (with in-place partitioning) are typically unstable sorts and somewhat complex, but are among the fastest sorting algorithms in practice. Together with its modest O(log n) space usage, quicksort is one of the most popular sorting algorithms and is available in many standard programming libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important caveat about quicksort is that its worst-case performance is O(n2); while this is rare, in naive implementations (choosing the first or last element as pivot) this occurs for sorted data, which is a common case. The most complex issue in quicksort is thus choosing a good pivot element, as consistently poor choices of pivots can result in drastically slower O(n2) performance, but good choice of pivots yields O(n log n) performance, which is asymptotically optimal. For example, if at each step the median is chosen as the pivot then the algorithm works in O(n log n). Finding the median, such as by the median of medians selection algorithm is however an O(n) operation on unsorted lists and therefore exacts significant overhead with sorting. In practice choosing a random pivot almost certainly yields O(n log n) performance.\n",
